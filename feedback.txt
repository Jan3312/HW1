Hi Jan,
this is a strange submission - you did not follow the naming convention and there are program files in this submission that do not belong here, e.g., Company.

It appears that your submission lacks proper environments for storing macros and variables and scopes, there is no implementation for nested scopes with shadowing and holes. You have earned 3%.

Thank you,
Mark
